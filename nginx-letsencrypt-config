1. Install certbot and add letsencrypt folder

wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto
mkdir -p /var/www/letsencrypt/

2. Create the file /tmp/my-domain.conf, where my‑domain is your fully qualified domain name (for example, 7gwifi.org).
```
# the domain we want to get the cert for;
# technically it's possible to have multiple of this lines, but it only worked
# with one domain for me, another one only got one cert, so I would recommend
# separate config files per domain.
domains = 7gwifi.org

# increase key size
rsa-key-size = 2048 # Or 4096

# the current closed beta (as of 2015-Nov-07) is using this server
server = https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

# this address will receive renewal reminders
email = my-email

# turn off the ncurses UI, we want this to be run as a cronjob
text = True

# authenticate by placing a file in the webroot (under .well-known/acme-challenge/)
# and then letting LE fetch it
authenticator = webroot
webroot-path = /var/www/letsencrypt/

```

3. Allowing Let’s Encrypt to Access the Temporary File

location /.well-known/acme-challenge {
        root /var/www/letsencrypt;
    }
		
4. Validate the nginx configuration and restart it 
sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload

5. ./certbot-auto --config /tmp/my-domain.conf certonly
